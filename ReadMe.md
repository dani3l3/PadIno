'Pad-ino' MIDI 6 Drum Pads Controller by Plank guitars and musical things by Shambien (Daniele Muscetta) - https://www.shambien.com

v.01 - initial version

Works on Arduino Pro Micro / Leonardo - UNTESTED on any other board (but it should work on all those based on the Atmega32U4 chipset).


Contains portions of code, inspiration and teachings derived from various sources such as: 
- Arduino MIDIUSB Library https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MIDIUSB
- Simple DYI Electronic Music Projects https://github.com/diyelectromusic/sdemp
- Nerd Musician (Gustavo Silveira) https://github.com/silveirago and https://www.youtube.com/@NerdMusician
- BeginnerToPro https://www.youtube.com/@BeginnerTopro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SL-W1Ynn3c (the hardware circuit I built - piezo's, resistors and diodes - is based on this video)
- Autonomia Digital https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU0ZmjipUU0 https://www.youtube.com/@autonomiadigital9664

...and many other sources I consulted and learned from but I did not bookmark.

I cannot thank all of the authors of the above enough for teaching me! May God bless you always.
